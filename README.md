- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From the challenge I learnt 2 things:
1. CSS flex-group. 
CSS Flex Groups, also known as Flexbox, is a layout model that allows you to create complex layouts with ease. It provides a flexible way to distribute space and align items within a container, making it a powerful tool for responsive web design. A flex container is an HTML element that holds a group of flex items. To create a flex container, you need to apply the `display: flex;` property to it. This property establishes a new flex formatting context for its children.

```css
.flex-group{
    display: flex;
}
```

2. CSS grid-auto-flow.
A CSS property used in grid layouts to determine how grid items are automatically placed within a grid container when there is more content than explicitly defined grid tracks. This property offers three main values: row, column, and dense. When set to row, new items are placed in rows, stacking vertically. When set to column, they are placed in columns, stacking horizontally. The dense value is particularly useful; it attempts to fill in any gaps left by empty grid cells, optimizing space utilization. By using grid-auto-flow, you can control the flow of content in your grid layout, creating dynamic and flexible designs without specifying exact placement for every item.
```css
.grid-flow{
    display: grid;
    align-content: start;
    gap: 1rem;
}
```
